    "# Seq2seq: The verbose, lengthy, detailed implementation; Part 1: Training seq2seq\n",
    "I first learned about seq2seq in the amazing Stanford open course [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/). This is, hands down, one of the must-take courses if you are keen to understand deep learning better, particularly their applications in Natural Language Processing. The skillset they provided in this course is can be definitely carried over to other domain of deep learning such as in the domain of vision. They have also provided assignments for you to get your hands dirty to really understand what you learn in the class and how are they connected to the implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this course is that I am quite convinced that I can articulate what a *seq2seq* model is, what they do, and how are they constructed, but one particular problem I faced is that after I fired up my Python program and imported the Tensorflow package try to try my hands on implementing the *seq2seq* model, I get stucked after every few lines and cannot proceed beyond creating an embedding layer. Perhaps I have missed some of the important points throughout my journey in CS224N, but it just seems like there is this big gap between learning from classes and to really implement them on your own (*disclaimer: I have not complete assignment 4, maybe that's why*). Looking at the tutorials and guide outside, a lot of the times the function they used are some really high level function that hides away a lot of the details. This is a problem for me because to really appreciate the convenience provided by those high level functions, I will need to see for myself what do the low-level functions lacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One prime example I came across is the convenient `Decoder` object provided by Tensorflow, together with a `TrainingHelper` object, just define your parameters correctly and it shall decode nicely. It has been an immense challenge to wrap my tiny head around this set of objects and functions as I am used to seeing the \"decoding\" process in a step by step manners, where you get the final hidden state from encoder, feed it into the decoder as initial hidden state along with some indicative tokens such as `<start>` which shall serve as the first input to decoder. Depending on whether the model is in training or inference mode, we will feed either the label token or the previously predicted token into the decoder as the input for $t=2$, $t=3$, and so on. Therefore, I have decided to try and implement on my own, with the help from several \"minimal\" *seq2seq* implementation from other authors to better understand the whole process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing the text above, the purpose of this document is twofold: \n",
    "1. It serves to demonstrate the implementation of **seq2seq** model with the least convoluted functions available in Tensorflow pacakges.\n",
    "2. The explanations of code (and sometimes even the code themselves) are purposely made as verbose in order for people who is coming directly from a theory class to connect better. \n",

    "No doubt the *seq2seq* model can process datasets that are complex in nature (such as news, articles, and etc.). However since clarity is the main focus in this demonstration, a very simple Question and Answering dataset has been artificially created and our model will learn these two examples only. For the sake of clarity, I have manipulate the string data manually so that it can be shown what we are dealing with. The purpose is for user not to dwell too much on data preparation, and just get over it quickly and head straight to *seq2seq* implementation. However, it is impossible to understand the implementation if you do not grasp what data we are processing firmly, hence the simple data example as well as the \"stupid\" data processing process.\n",

After that, each word will be mapped into their respective index based on our dictionary so that we end up with an arrays of number. In addition to that, we will add several special tokens which serve different purposes:\n",

    "At each timesteps, using the `hidden_states` output by the RNN cell, we will \"project\" it into the vocab space by putting a feed forward neural network there, which enable us to project a tensor of shape `hidden_state_size` to `vocab_size`. After the projection, softmax can be applied and using function `argmax`, we can get the index of the decoded word.\n"

    "2. Notice how in the \"Translated pred_v at current iter\", the last 2 word isn't being printed out. That's because we are not interested in the padding value prediction anyway, so I have purposely masked it using the same `mask_v` value.\n",
    "3. Finally, notice how the \"predicted sentence\" gets closer to our ground truth label as the iteration number increases, and the `batch_loss_v` value decreases, which indicate that we are fitting our model to the data given. \n",

    "In this part, we have implemented the process to train our *seq2seq* model using the (hopefully) least convoluted function we have to really see things for ourselves. Keen reader might notice that our decoder requires input at each time steps in order to generate output. We know that in normal use case, all the decoder need is a \"start token\" and the final `hidden_state` from encoder to start generating output. In the next part, we will see how we can implement the *seq2seq* so that it can carry out inference mode with minimal changes to our current code."
