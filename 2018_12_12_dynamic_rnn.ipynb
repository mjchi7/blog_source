        "\n",
        "This document is based largely on the excellent [source](http://www.wildml.com/2016/08/rnns-in-tensorflow-a-practical-guide-and-undocumented-features/) where it documents a lot of important tips and tricks. The problem I find is that it lacks a lengthy discussion of `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`, and how to interpret its outputs, which is what this document hope to achieve.\n",

        "## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of neural network that excels at data that exhibit certain temporal pattern (such as sentences, audio signal, time series data, and etc.). The main idea behind RNN is that, say we have a sequence of data as such:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "data = [\"Some\", \"random\", \"data\", \".\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "The data can be viewed in terms of `time_steps`, where the element `\"Some\"` can be refer to *input at time step 1*, $x_{t=1}$, `\"random\"` as $x_{t=2}$, `\"data\"` as $x_{t=3}$, and `\".\"` as $x_{t=4}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "![figure-1](source\\2018_12_12_dynamic_rnn\\diag1_rnn_normal.png)  \n",
        "Figure 1: Basic RNN Operation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The RNN will take as input the first datum `\"Some\"`, pass it into the network, producing an output $y_{t=1}$ and hidden state representation $h_{t=2}$ using a set of weight $W_{rnn}$ and bias $b_{rnn}$. For the second data point `\"random\"`, the network will again use back the **same set of weight and bias, $W_{rnn}$ and $b_{rnn}$** to produce an output $y_{t=2}$ and hidden state representation $h_{t=2}$. This will go on until the hidden state and output for ${t=3}$ and $t=4$ are computed. If reader is interested to understand more on RNN, here is a very good [resource](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Let's implement it\n",
        "The way to implement it, intuitively, is to conduct a for loop for how many time steps there is, in each time step we pass in the previous hidden states $h_{t-1}$ and current input $x_t$\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "h_t = np.zeros(0)\n",
        "for step in timestep:\n",
        "\th_t_prev = h_t\n",
        "\th_t = sigmoid(W_x * x_t + W_h * h_t_prev)\n",
        "```\n",
        "*Note: The equation aren't exactly complete in the sense that a bias term is purposely left out for the sake of clarity. The important thing to note here is how we are re-using the same weights when we go through the sequence*\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation is known as [**static unrolled rnn**](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/static_rnn). It forces user to define how many time steps are there through the variable `timestep` prior to building the computation graph, which cause the following disadvantage:\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Computation resources wastage \n",
        "Imagine if your training data contains 2 sentences of length 10 and 6. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Sentence 1**: \"I love pineapple on pizza regardless of what people say\".  \n",
        "> **Sentence 2**: \"But pineapple on pizza is disgusting\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In order  to make the computation works, you will need to zero pad the second sentence of length 6 so that it has length of 10, as such:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Sentence 2**: \"But pineapple on pizza is disgusting **<pad\\> <pad\\> <pad\\> <pad\\>**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "During forward propagation, since the computation graph have been defined strictly to loop for 10 times (to accommodate the longest sentence - in this case sentence 1), the **<pad\\>** value in the second sentence will also undergo the same computation, which we know isn't necessary. In other word, the ideal case is to stop computing after the 6th word. \n",
        "\n",
        "### `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` to the rescue!\n",
        "*tf.nn.dynamic_rnn* is a way to counter the concern raised above: it will not compute the <pad\\> value of sentence and just append vector of \"0\" so the matrix size agree.\n",
        "In order to do that, tf.nn.dynamic_rnn requires an additional input: `sequence_length`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `sequence_length`\n",
        "This parameter is an input of type `tf.int32` and of shape `[batch_size]`. The value in this parameter should tell the function *\"how long is each sentence in this batch?\"*. Continuing with our example above, for the two sentences, their respective `sequence_length` parameters should be \n",
        "```python\n",
        "sequence_length = [10, 6]\n",
        "```\n",
        "With this parameter, the function `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` will know for current sentence, when should it stop computing the hidden states and return the computed states, instead of continuing with the calculation for \\<pad> value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keen reader by now should be wondering: What about the outputs of hidden states for the <pad\\> value? The reason this question might pop up is because you understand that in some advance implementation, certain mechanism (such as Attention) requires all the hidden states value from all the time steps and the shape should agree regardless of the batch they belong to. In another words, taking our first sentence as example, in the end of the RNN forward propagation, we should have a hidden states Tensor coming out from all the time steps\n",

        "What `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` will do is to simply set the hidden state of skipped tokens (the <pad\\> value it didn't calculate) to vectors of zeros of the size **`[hidden_state_size]`**\n",
